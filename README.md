## High Priority Enhancements/Bug Fixes
- [x] Color ramp linear and b-spline interpolation shows weird red when using monotone control points
- [ ] Replace interpolation in code with dedicated function from `Interpolation` class
- [x] Bilinear scaling (`Image::preview_color_ramp` then scale to a large image via `Image::f_scale` with `TwoDimInterp::Biliea` as interpolation method
- [x] Refactor `Adjustment`, `Color` and `Font` from `image.h`

## Medium Priority Enhancements/Bug Fixes
- [ ] Standardize `Color` class function design
- [ ] Optimize memory for `Image::perlin_noise` (overuse of array memory for gradient vectors)
- [ ] Different interpolation methods for each channel for RGB curves
- [ ] Show area instead of line in RGB curve preview
- [ ] Show control points in RGB curve preview
- [ ] Single channel image support for rgb curves
- [x] Merge preview of RGB curves to one image
- [ ] Replace retrieving and setting data with dedicated get and set functions from `Image` class
- [ ] Test `Color::apply_adj_rgb` thoroughly for hue, saturation, value, lift, gamma, gain
- [ ] Support separated channel images in `Image::HSV`
- [ ] Color class HSV integration
- [ ] Demo images in `README.md`
- [ ] Ensure uniformity of logic when using data from another image (first channel vs. average grayscale vs. separated channel image)
- [ ] Unnecessary memory use/leaks
- [x] Rename `enum` to generalize for 1-D and 2-D interpolation methods

## Low Priority Enhancements/Bug Fixes
- [ ] Clean up code in `Image::false_color` function
- [ ] Use `uint_t` and `size_t` where necessary
- [ ] Edge bleeding in edge detection via `Image::edge()` function due to Fast Fourier transform limitations
- [ ] Sobel edge detection gradient for single channel images
- [ ] Make makefile build/run more efficient
- [x] Refactor `src/` and move library files into `src/lib/`
